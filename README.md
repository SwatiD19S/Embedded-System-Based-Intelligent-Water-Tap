# Embedded-System-Based-Intelligent-Water-Tap
Third Year Mini Project

Every work done by human beings has always been susceptible to errors, but when this error paves the way for wastage of water, especially in areas which are already facing its shortage, or where water seldom visits the taps, it surely demands for technical solutions. Here, we tackle this need by automating the water filling process so that while a person is waiting for his container to be filled, or if he gets distracted while filling the container, the tap closes itself and hence saves the important resource. The container is surrounded by infrared sensors to calculate its height. This information is used by the microcontroller to control the solenoid valve for switching off the tap when the water fills up to a certain level. To measure the height of the water inside the container, the ultrasonic sensor is fixed at the top of the system. The system thus uses basic sensors and science to handle the subtle but huge wastage of water.

The system can be installed in slum areas where there is a daily routine of fights in the neighbourhoods while filling water in their containers.
